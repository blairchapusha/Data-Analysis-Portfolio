# Identifying At-risk Demographics for Poor Credit Management

## Introduction

This project is centered around a dataset collected from an anonymous bank, *Bank A*. This analysis was focused on the following demographics: age, gender, dependents, education, marital status and income. 

## Analytical Process

### 1. Defining Objectives

Identify which demographics are most at-risk for poor credit management, in order for Bank A's management to better tailor its credit card services. The benefit of this being a reduction is potential churning customers, who close out their accounts due to outstanding fees.

> i. Downloaded the dataset in CSV format and imported it into Microsoft Excel using the Data tool
 
    ii. Collected the necessary data in separate Excel sheet
 
    iii. Created a database and data table in Microsoft SQL Server to store collected data
 
    iii. Exported the data to Microsoft SQL Server's database for deeper analysis

### 3. Data Cleaning

Utilized MS SQL Server to clean the data

    i. Removed any duplicates, outliers, blank data and incorrect data
 
    ii. Created additional data points using current data points for better analysis
 
    iii. Connected the database to Tableau for visual analysis
 
### 4. Analysis

Utilized MS SQL Server with Tableau in order to identify key patterns and insights

**Insights**: 
    
    i. High revolving balance in a low income category with a high transaction count was a strong indicator
